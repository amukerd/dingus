# This is for the Roblox game Dingus

I advise you to look straight down before clicking the 'Do Tasks' button because camera clipping can make the task stop

Also most of the time the first task will Not get done, idk how to fix, just deal with it

Loadstring:
```
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amukerd/dingus/refs/heads/main/main.lua'))()
